# Mohammed Ayan - Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. This is a fully responsive, single-page site built with clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing my projects, skills, and contact information.

About The Project
This project is more than just a static page; it's an interactive experience designed to be clean, modern, and engaging. It features a unique starry background that fades on scroll, a dynamic project showcase system with a pop-up and slider, and several other micro-interactions to create a polished user experience.

The main goal was to create a simple yet elegant platform to present my work in AI and ML including software engineering.

Key Features
- Dynamic Starry Background: An animated, multi-layered starry sky that seamlessly fades away as the user scrolls down.
- Interactive Projects Section: Click the "Projects" link or the main heading to open a pop-up modal. Selecting a category smoothly slides the corresponding projects into view.
- Glowing Text Effect: A seamless, glowing hover effect on the "(Click here for more projects)" text, created using advanced CSS text-shadow techniques.
- Single-Page Application (SPA) Feel: All sections are on a single page with smooth scrolling for seamless navigation.
- Fully Responsive: The layout adapts perfectly to desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- Direct Resume Access: A link in the navigation bar allows visitors to view my resume in a new tab.

Technologies Used:
- HTML5: For the structure and content.
- CSS3: For all styling, including Flexbox, CSS Variables, animations, and responsive design.
- JavaScript (ES6+): For all interactivity, including the scroll-based animations and the project slider functionality.

**PS: I will always be improving and updating this website with my learning journey**
